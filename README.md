# Inventory Management System DApp

This is an inventory management decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to efficiently manage and track their inventory using blockchain technology. It provides a secure and transparent solution for keeping track of stock levels, product information, and transactions.

## Features

1. **Inventory Tracking**: Easily add, update, and remove products from your inventory. Keep track of important details such as product name, description, quantity, and price.

2. **Transaction History**: Every transaction involving your inventory is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability. You can view a comprehensive history of all transactions, including sales, purchases, and inventory adjustments.

3. **Smart Contract Integration**: The DApp utilizes smart contracts to enforce business logic and automate inventory management processes. This ensures that inventory actions, such as adding or selling products, are executed securely and accurately.

4. **Secure and Decentralized**: Built on blockchain technology, the DApp ensures data integrity, security, and reliability. With decentralized storage, your inventory data is distributed across the network, making it resistant to single points of failure and tampering.

5. **User Access Control**: Manage multiple user accounts and assign different roles and permissions to each user. Control who can perform specific actions, such as adding products, editing inventory details, or generating reports.
